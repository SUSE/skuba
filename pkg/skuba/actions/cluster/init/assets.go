This directory contains all supported cloud provider integration configurations
and instructions.
 
- [~Openstack~](openstack/README.md)
- [~AWS~](aws/README.md)
- [~vSphere~](vsphere/README.md)

## Important

If you don't make any change on this directories the cluster will be deployed
with no specific cloud provider integration.
 
Only one cloud provider integration is supported for a given cluster.

## Cleanup

By enabling CPI providers your kubernetes cluster will be able to provision cloud
resources on its own (eg: Load Balancers, Persistent Volumes). You will have to manually
clean these resources before you destroy the cluster with terraform.

Warning!!! Please replace option values with variables from OpenStack RC file.

enabled when you bootstrap the cluster.

## Important
 
When the cloud provider integration is enabled, it's very important to bootstrap
and join nodes with the same node names that they have inside ~Openstack~, as
this name will be used by the ~Openstack~ cloud controller manager to reconcile
node metadata.
